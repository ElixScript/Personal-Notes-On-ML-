# Personal Notes on Machine Learni
Welcome to my comprehensive collection of notes on Machine Learning! This repository is designed to help learners navigate through machine learning concepts, algorithms, and coding practices in a simplified and practical way. As a data science enthusiast, I've compiled these notes to serve as a step-by-step guide into the world of Machine Learning.

## The Content : 
- Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for modeling.
- Regression: From Simple Linear Regression to Random Forest Regression, covering all key types of regression models.
- Classification: Learn popular classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, and more.
- Clustering: Dive into unsupervised learning with K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Association Rule Learning: Master Apriori and Eclat for pattern discovery.
- Reinforcement Learning: Understand Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Work with the Bag-of-Words model and apply machine learning to text data.
- Deep Learning: Explore Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Learn PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA for feature reduction.
